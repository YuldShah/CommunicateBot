# Communicate Bot
A bot to connect users with admin

## How to setup your own bot:
To create your own, you need, first, to create a bot at BotFather and a channel where messages sent by users will be forwarded to store. After creating them, you will need to put their id to `config.py` file on `data` folder. Replace `API_TOKEN` with your bot's `TOKEN` given by BotFather, `ADMIN_ID` with your user id and `CHANNEL_ID` with the messages channel id.

## Working example:
A working bot of mine - [Reach me out bot](https://t.me/ReachMeOut_Bot)
